# Week 2 - Averages, standard deviation, and standard error

## Mean

As you know, the mean (or average) is the sum of a group of numbers divided by the number of individual numbers.

There are a few base R functions that we can use to calculate the mean.

To calculate a mean, first we add up all the values that we are interested in using the `sum()` function.

Here, we will use the `rivers` dataset which is included in your installation of R. `rivers` is a predefined dataset and you can find out more about it by typing `?rivers` in the console. `rivers` is a *vector* which is a list of items that all have the same type (i.e. list of numbers, list of strings, etc.)

First, we add up all the elements of the vector `rivers` by using the function `sum()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
sum(rivers)
```

We can assign this value to a variable by using
